# 💫 About Me:
```Java
public class Profile {
    private static final String NAME = "Thore";
    private static final LocalDate BIRTH_DATE = LocalDate.of(1998,12, 5);
    private int age;

    public Profile() {
        this.age = Period.between(BIRTH_DATE, LocalDate.now()).getYears();
        whoAmI();
    }

    private void whoAmI() {
        System.out.printf("""
                        Hey! My name is %s, I'm %d years old and crazy about technology.
                        The diversity of computer science drives me to keep going.

    }

    public void age() {
